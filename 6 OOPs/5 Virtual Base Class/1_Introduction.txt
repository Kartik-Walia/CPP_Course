           |---------> Class B -------->|
Class A ---                              ---> Class D
           |---------> Class C -------->|

If class A has a member named 'a', then B & C will also inherit A 
Question is when D inherits from classes B & C, then it would take 2 instances of member 'a'

Virtual Base Class is solution of above case 
To solve this what we shoudl do is, make sure when someone in future takes a from both B and C, then check 
if there's already another instance of 'a' bcoz there must be only 1 instance of 'a'
To do this, we declare A as virtual base classe while declaring classes B & C 
We derived classes B & C with A as virtual base class 

Syntax :
class B : virtual public A {};
class C : virtual public A {};

This saves us from duplication and ambiguity 
When we made class B and class C, then we said that give me a as a virtual base class 

What we did is, we made D indirectly from A such that we got only copy of 'a' in class D
