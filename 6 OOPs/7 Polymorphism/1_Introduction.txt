POLYMORPHISM 
One name many forms 
- Function Overloading 
- Operator Overloading 
- Virtual Functions 


TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM 
1. Compile Time Polymorphism 
    Decision about which function to call is taken in compile time itself 
    Also known as "Early (or Static) Binding" 
    Binding means which object will call which function 
    Binding is done in compile time 

    In C++, Compile Time Polymorphism is achieved in 2 ways :
    A. Function Overloading 
    B. Operator Overloading 
2. Run Time Polymorphism 
    Compiler postpones decision of which function to call i.e. It defers the linking of function call in runtime
    After compiling, when you will execute program, then you would get to know which function is about to run 
    according to the type of your pointer
    No binding takes place in runtime polymorphism
    Also known as "Late (or Dynamic) Binding"

    In C++, Run Time Polymorphism is achieved with help of virtual functions
