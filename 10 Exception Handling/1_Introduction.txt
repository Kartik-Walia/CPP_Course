WHAT ARE EXCEPTIONS ?
Exceptions are the unexpected situations that arise during the execution of a program.
These exceptions exhibit odd behaviour ina  program that should be taken care of.


WHY DO WE NEED EXCEPTION HANDLING ?
Exception Hanlding provides a mechanism through which we can handle the error generating part separately 
from the rest of the code.
It provides the information to the suer, so that he/she can detect the mistake and correct it.


WHAT IS EXCEPTION HANDLING IN C++ ?
Exception Handling helps in dealing with exceptions by transferring the control from one part of the 
program to another and takes care of the exception by providing certain code.


KEYWORDS OF EXCEPTION HANDLING 
Exceptions are handled with the help of 3 keywords.
1. Try : This part assumes that error will take place.
2. Catch : This part identifies which exception has occured and tries to catch it.
3. Throw : When the program encounters an issue, it throws an exception.


SYNTAX 
try {
    // try block code 
}
catch (Exception_Name exception1){
    // catch block
}
catch (Exception_Name exception2){
    // catch block
}
catch (Exception_Name exception3){
    // catch block
}


TRY BLOCK 
Try blocks are used to enclose the statements which may cause the exceptions.
The try block is followed up by 1 or more than 1 catch blocks.
The exceptions will be thrown from the try block towards the catch block.


CATCH BLOCK
Handling these exceptions is teh actual job of the catch block. 
This block catches the exception thrown from the try block.

Both the try and catch blocks work together. 
Every try block has atleast 1 catch block attached to it.


THROW STATEMENT 
The throw statement is used to throw an exception and its value to a consecutive exception handler.
Whenever a program experiences an issue, the throw keyword assists the program by performing the operation.
