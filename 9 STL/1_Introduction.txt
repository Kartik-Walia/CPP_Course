STL - Standard Template Library 
It's a library of generic classes and functions 


WHY USE STL ?
- Reuse : Well tested components
- Saves time!
STL is used bcoz it's a good idea not to reinvent the wheel


COMPONENTS OF STL 
1. Containers
    These are already implemented classes which we can use by including the library 
    They use template classes 
    It's an object which stores data
    Eg: vector, etc.
2. Algorithms 
    Set of procedure which is used to manipulate data to get to the result 
    They use template functions
    Eg: seraching, sorting, etc.
3. Iterators
    It's an object which points to an element in a container 
    Handled just like pointers (but it's an opbject)
    It connects Algorithms with Containers & plays a major role in data manipulation
