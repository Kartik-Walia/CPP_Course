TYPES OF CONTAINERS 
1. Sequence Containers
    Stores data in Linear Fashion
    Eg: vector, list, dequeue, etc.
2. Associative Containers 
    Desgined in such a way to get faster access of elements, direct access 
    In associative container, you can't do random access, so access becomes slow
    Eg: set, multiset, map, multimap, etc.
3. Derived Containers
    Derived from either Sequence or Associative Containers 
    Real world modelling 
    Eg: stack, queue, priority_queue 


SEQUENCE CONATINERS 
1. Vector 
    Random access = Fast
    Middle insertion/deletion = Slow
    Insertion at end = Fast 
2. List (Linked Lists)
    Random access = Slow 
    Middle insertion/deletion = Fast 
    Insertion at end = Fast 


ASSOCIATIVE CONATINERS 
Searching, Inserting, Deleting... 
All operations are fast except random access (bcoz it stores in form of tree)


DERIVED CONTAINERS 
Depends on data structure
